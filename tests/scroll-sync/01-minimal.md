# 01 Minimal

This file is intentionally *boring*: headers + paragraphs only.
It should still be long enough that both panes can scroll meaningfully.

## Section A

Paragraph A1. This paragraph is intentionally long enough to wrap in the preview. It repeats a few phrases to create stable height across zoom levels.

Paragraph A2. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Paragraph A3. A slightly different sentence rhythm helps catch “drift” where the preview and source gradually diverge after many wrapped lines.

Paragraph A4. More wrapping. More wrapping. More wrapping. More wrapping. More wrapping. More wrapping. More wrapping.

Paragraph A5. More wrapping. More wrapping. More wrapping. More wrapping. More wrapping. More wrapping.

## Section B

Paragraph B1. This section is similar, but not identical. We want scroll-sync to be stable even when the content is repetitive.

Paragraph B2. Repeat: preview height should be predictable; source height is line-based; the mapping should not “snap” to the wrong marker.

Paragraph B3. Repeat: preview height should be predictable; source height is line-based; the mapping should not “snap” to the wrong marker.

Paragraph B5. One more paragraph, still plain text. One more paragraph, still plain text.

## Section C

Paragraph C2. This paragraph is intentionally long: it contains commas, periods, and short clauses; it should wrap across multiple lines in the preview.

Paragraph C3. Another long paragraph. Another long paragraph. Another long paragraph. Another long paragraph. Another long paragraph.

[[M:01.06]]

Paragraph C4. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.

Paragraph C5. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.
